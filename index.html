      <p class="news_paragraph_main">
      The Intergalactic government of Solar System One has officially declared that "Earth Prime", the original earth, is a dead and uninhabited planet. With the enormous amounts of greenhouse gases emissions that corrupt the atmosphere of <i>"Earth Prime"</i>, it is extremely unhealthy to be living on the planet. There are still signs of living organisms on the deserted planet, but, "without proper equipment and clothing there'll be major health risks if any human decides to live on "Earth Prime" in it's current status" concluded SS1 Health and Benefits.

      <p class="news_paragraph_main"> Expert analysises along with some of the greatest minds of the century have gathered at Mar's Environmental Gathering. They have concluded that with time and a couple small developments in technology with the understanding of biology, <i>"Earth Prime"</i> can and will be restored to the original thriving "blue world" that it once was.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="news_paragraph_main">With the the statement from the gathering, there has been a reward issued by the government towards anyone that can invent any technique/technology that can clean "<i>"Earth Prime"</i> quickly and cost efficient. The reward number isn't stated but officals have debated it being from low numbers of 10 million upwards to possbily 500 million Solar Credits. The requirements of the invention to claim the reward are being uploaded on SS1G and SS1 Technology Inc. later during this month.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="news_paragraph_main">"Till further notice. '<i>'Earth Prime'</i> will be quarantined and any person that are below the <em>class of Demeter, Hermes, Hephaestus, or Titan classes</em> are <strong>forbinned</strong> to enter <i>'Earth Prime's'</i> toxic atomsphere. Anyone that's caught entering will be imprisoned for the act of trespassing, treason, or evasion of the law. Any citizens of 'Earth Prime' with ranks above 'Artemis', will be allocated to the moons of Jupiter, Mars, or Pluto. Anyone below the 'Hermes' rank will be allowed to inhabit one refugee stations obiting Saturn, but will have the option to stay with relatives that aren't lving in the Zues or Posident class celestial bodies (Europia, Venus, and 'Earth-02' in SOlar System 4). Updates about any Solar System One developments will be announced by 'Earth Prime SS1 Government"<br><span id="helena"><i>-Representative, Helena Georgina Anupama Rye, of The Intergalactic Government of Solar System One</i></span></p>
